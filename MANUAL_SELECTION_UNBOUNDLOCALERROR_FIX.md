# Manual Selection UnboundLocalError Fix

## Issue Description
The application was crashing with an `UnboundLocalError` when trying to use manual selection modes:

```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'manual_selection_rect' where it is not associated with a value
```

This error occurred in the `complete_manual_selection()` function when trying to access the `manual_selection_rect` variable.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **variable scope problems** in the nested function structure:

1. **Missing `nonlocal` declarations**: The `complete_manual_selection()` function was trying to access and modify `manual_selection_rect` but didn't have the proper `nonlocal` declaration.

2. **Incomplete function implementation**: The `cancel_manual_selection()` function was incomplete and didn't properly reset the selection state.

3. **Variable access without proper scope**: Python's scoping rules require explicit `nonlocal` declarations when nested functions need to modify variables from the enclosing scope.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `complete_manual_selection()` function
**Before:**
```python
def complete_manual_selection():
    nonlocal manual_selecting  # ❌ Missing manual_selection_rect
    if manual_selecting and manual_selection_rect:  # ❌ UnboundLocalError here
        # ... processing code ...
    manual_selecting = False
    manual_selection_rect = None  # ❌ UnboundLocalError here
```

**After:**
```python
def complete_manual_selection():
    nonlocal manual_selecting, manual_selection_rect  # ✅ Both variables declared
    if manual_selecting and manual_selection_rect:
        x, y, w, h = manual_selection_rect
        if w > 10 and h > 10:  # Minimum size check
            print(f"[MANUAL] Selected area: {w}x{h} pixels at ({x}, {y})")
            # Shape snapping logic
            if current_mode == "MANUAL_CIRCLE":
                print(f"[MANUAL] Looking for circle in selection...")
            elif current_mode == "MANUAL_RECT":
                print(f"[MANUAL] Looking for rectangle in selection...")
    manual_selecting = False
    manual_selection_rect = None
```

### 2. Fixed `cancel_manual_selection()` function
**Before:**
```python
def cancel_manual_selection():
    nonlocal manual_selecting, manual_selection_rect
    manual_selecting = False
    # ❌ Incomplete - missing manual_selection_rect reset and feedback
```

**After:**
```python
def cancel_manual_selection():
    nonlocal manual_selecting, manual_selection_rect
    manual_selecting = False
    manual_selection_rect = None  # ✅ Properly reset selection
    print("[MANUAL] Selection cancelled")  # ✅ User feedback
```

### 3. Verified other functions have proper scope
All other manual selection functions already had correct `nonlocal` declarations:

- ✅ `start_manual_selection()` - correctly declares all needed variables
- ✅ `update_manual_selection()` - correctly declares needed variables
- ✅ `cycle_mode()` - correctly declares `current_mode`

## Variable Scope Structure
The manual selection system uses these variables in the nested function scope:

```python
# Outer scope variables (in main function)
current_mode = "AUTO"
manual_selecting = False
manual_start_point = None
manual_current_point = None
manual_selection_rect = None

# Nested functions that need nonlocal access
def start_manual_selection(x, y):
    nonlocal manual_selecting, manual_start_point, manual_current_point, manual_selection_rect
    # ... function body ...

def update_manual_selection(x, y):
    nonlocal manual_current_point, manual_selection_rect
    # ... function body ...

def complete_manual_selection():
    nonlocal manual_selecting, manual_selection_rect  # ✅ Fixed
    # ... function body ...

def cancel_manual_selection():
    nonlocal manual_selecting, manual_selection_rect  # ✅ Fixed
    # ... function body ...
```

## Testing and Verification

### Test Results
- ✅ **Variable scope test**: All functions can access and modify variables correctly
- ✅ **Manual selection workflow**: Start → Update → Complete works without errors
- ✅ **Manual selection cancellation**: Start → Update → Cancel works without errors
- ✅ **Mode switching**: Cycling through modes works correctly
- ✅ **Error handling**: No more UnboundLocalError exceptions

### Test Coverage
The fix was verified with:
1. **Unit tests** for individual function scope
2. **Integration tests** for complete manual selection workflow
3. **Error simulation** to ensure the UnboundLocalError is resolved
4. **Mode switching tests** to ensure overall functionality

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact
- ✅ **Fixed critical crash**: Manual selection modes now work without UnboundLocalError
- ✅ **Improved user experience**: Users can now switch to manual modes and use them
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Proper cleanup when selections are cancelled
- ✅ **Enhanced feedback**: Users get console feedback about their selections

### No Breaking Changes
- ✅ All existing functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ Automatic mode continues to work as before
- ✅ No changes to function signatures or return values
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Usage Instructions

### Manual Mode Workflow
1. **Switch to manual mode**: Press 'M' to cycle to MANUAL_RECT or MANUAL_CIRCLE
2. **Create selection**: Click and drag to select an area
3. **Complete selection**: Release mouse button to complete selection
4. **Cancel selection**: Right-click to cancel active selection
5. **Switch modes**: Press 'M' to cycle between modes

### Expected Behavior
- **Mode switching**: Instant response when pressing 'M'
- **Selection feedback**: Real-time rectangle display during dragging
- **Console output**: Informative messages about selections and mode changes
- **Error-free operation**: No more UnboundLocalError crashes

## Files Modified
1. `main.py` - Fixed variable scope issues in manual selection functions
2. `test_manual_selection_fix.py` - Created comprehensive test suite
3. `MANUAL_SELECTION_UNBOUNDLOCALERROR_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Technical Details

### Python Scoping Rules
The fix addresses Python's **LEGB rule** (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in):
- **Local**: Variables defined in the current function
- **Enclosing**: Variables in the enclosing function scope (where `nonlocal` is needed)
- **Global**: Module-level variables
- **Built-in**: Python built-in names

### Nonlocal Declaration
The `nonlocal` keyword tells Python that a variable refers to a previously bound variable in the nearest enclosing scope that is not global.

```python
def outer():
    x = 10  # Enclosing scope
    
    def inner():
        nonlocal x  # Required to modify x from enclosing scope
        x = 20      # Without nonlocal, this would create a new local variable
    
    inner()
    print(x)  # Prints 20
```

## Summary
The UnboundLocalError has been completely resolved by adding proper `nonlocal` declarations to the manual selection functions. The manual mode switching now works correctly, and users can:

- Press 'M' to cycle between AUTO → MANUAL_RECT → MANUAL_CIRCLE modes
- Use click-and-drag selection in manual modes
- See real-time visual feedback during selection
- Cancel selections with right-click
- Experience error-free operation

The fix maintains full backward compatibility while enabling the enhanced manual selection functionality.
