## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Module: `adaptive_threshold_calibrator.py`

A complete adaptive threshold calibration system with the following components:

#### Dynamic Lighting Analysis

- Bimodal distribution detection
- Lighting condition classification (underexposed/normal/overexposed)

#### Intelligent Parameter Calibration
- Adaptive block size selection based on image characteristics
- Dynamic C constant adjustment based on lighting conditions
- Context-aware parameter tuning using standard deviation and dynamic range
- Automatic clamping to valid OpenCV parameter ranges

#### Contrast Enhancement
- CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Selective application based on image contrast levels
- Only applies enhancement when beneficial (std < 30)

#### Multi-Pass Threshold Strategy

## How to Use

### Basic Usage (Automatic)

The adaptive threshold calibration is automatically integrated. Simply ensure it's enabled in `config.py`:

```python
ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD = True
```

No code changes are needed - the system will automatically use adaptive thresholding in place of the standard fixed-parameter approach.

### Advanced Configuration

Fine-tune the behavior using config parameters:

```python
# Enable/disable specific features
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_ENABLE_CLAHE = True      # Contrast enhancement
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_ENABLE_MULTIPASS = True  # Multi-pass refinement
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_ENABLE_LOCAL = True      # Local adaptive processing

# CLAHE parameters
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_CLAHE_CLIP_LIMIT = 2.0
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD_CLAHE_TILE_SIZE = 8
```

### Direct API Usage

For custom processing:

```python
from adaptive_threshold_calibrator import AdaptiveThresholdCalibrator

calibrator = AdaptiveThresholdCalibrator()
binary_image, stats = calibrator.calibrate_and_threshold(input_image)

# Access calibration stats
print(f"Used block size: {stats['block_size']}")
print(f"Used C constant: {stats['c_constant']}")
print(f"Lighting condition: {stats['lighting_stats']['lighting_condition']}")
```
