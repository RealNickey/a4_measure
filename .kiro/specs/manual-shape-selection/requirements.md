# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing A4 object dimension scanner with manual shape selection capabilities and improved contour analysis. While the current system automatically detects object dimensions accurately, it struggles with detecting shapes within shapes (nested shapes). This enhancement will allow users to manually select and snap to specific shapes (circles and rectangles) within a manually drawn selection area, and provide better contour analysis through advanced thresholding techniques.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user measuring complex objects, I want to manually select shapes within shapes, so that I can accurately measure nested geometric features that automatic detection misses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters manual selection mode THEN the system SHALL provide rectangle and circle selection modes
2. WHEN the user draws a rough rectangle over a shape THEN the system SHALL automatically snap to the most prominent circle or rectangle within that selection area
3. WHEN the user selects rectangle mode THEN the system SHALL prioritize detecting and snapping to rectangular shapes within the manual selection
4. WHEN the user selects circle mode THEN the system SHALL prioritize detecting and snapping to circular shapes within the manual selection
5. WHEN a shape is successfully snapped THEN the system SHALL display the detected shape boundaries and provide measurement data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user working with complex objects with varying lighting conditions, I want enhanced contour analysis capabilities, so that I can get better shape detection in challenging scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhanced contour analysis mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL apply Adaptive Gaussian thresholding
2. WHEN processing images for contour analysis THEN the system SHALL convert images to grayscale before applying thresholding
3. WHEN Adaptive Gaussian thresholding is applied THEN the system SHALL provide better edge detection for shapes with varying lighting conditions
4. WHEN enhanced mode is active THEN the system SHALL use the improved contour data for both automatic and manual shape detection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user switching between automatic and manual detection modes, I want a seamless interface, so that I can efficiently choose the best detection method for each measurement task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in inspect mode THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to switch between automatic and manual selection modes
2. WHEN manual mode is activated THEN the system SHALL display mode indicators showing current selection type (rectangle/circle)
3. WHEN the user presses a designated key THEN the system SHALL cycle between rectangle mode, circle mode, and automatic mode
4. WHEN in manual mode THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the selection process
5. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL preserve the current measurement session and display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user making manual selections, I want intuitive drawing controls, so that I can quickly and accurately select the areas I want to measure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks and drags in manual mode THEN the system SHALL draw a selection rectangle in real-time
2. WHEN the user releases the mouse button THEN the system SHALL process the selected area for shape detection
3. WHEN no valid shape is found in the selection THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and allow re-selection
4. WHEN multiple shapes are detected in the selection THEN the system SHALL snap to the most prominent shape based on the current mode (circle/rectangle)
5. WHEN a selection is made THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of the detected shape boundaries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user measuring objects, I want the manual selection to integrate with the existing measurement system, so that I get consistent measurement data regardless of detection method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shape is manually selected and snapped THEN the system SHALL provide the same measurement data format as automatic detection
2. WHEN manual measurements are made THEN the system SHALL display dimensions in millimeters using the same A4 calibration
3. WHEN shapes are detected manually THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing hit-testing and interaction system
4. WHEN manual and automatic detections coexist THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between detection methods in the display
5. WHEN measurements are complete THEN the system SHALL allow users to return to automatic detection mode seamlessly
