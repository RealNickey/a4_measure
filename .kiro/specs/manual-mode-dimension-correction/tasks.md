- [x] 2. Fix manual rectangle dimension conversion to use proper scaling factors




  - Modify `_convert_manual_rectangle_to_measurement()` function in measure.py

  - Ensure box coordinates remain in pixels for rendering purposes
  - Handle axis-specific scaling for accurate rectangular measurements
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.4, 2.2_


- [x] 3. Update manual selection processing to pass scaling factors correctly





  - Modify `process_manual_selection()` function in measure.py
  - Ensure `mm_per_px_x` and `mm_per_px_y` parameters are properly passed to conversion functions
  - Add validation to verify scaling factors are positive and within reasonable ranges
  - Maintain existing error handling while adding scaling factor validation



  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Verify main.py integration passes correct scaling factors to manual mode






  - Review manual selection workflow in main.py
  - Ensure `mm_per_px_x` and `mm_per_px_y` from A4 calibration are passed to manual processing
  - Verify manual mode receives same scaling factors as automatic detection


  - Test that manual selection integration maintains existing user interaction workflow
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.4, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Add measurement validation and consistency checking







  - Create validation function to compare Auto vs Manual measureme
nts
  - Implement tolerance checking (±2mm or ±2% whichever is larger)
  - Add logging for measurement consistency warnings
  - Create helper function to validate measurement result data structure
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_



- [x] 6. Create unit tests for dimension conversion functions







  - Write test for `_convert_manual_circle_to_measurement()` with known scaling factors

  - Test scaling factor validation and error handling
  - Test measurement result data structure consistency

  --_Requirements: 1.3, 2.4, 4.5_



- [x] 7. Create integration tests for manual vs auto measurement consistency





  - Test complete manual selection workflow with proper dimension output
  - Compare measurements of same object using both Auto and Manual modes

  - Verify measurements are within acceptable tolerance ranges

  - Maintain existing shape detection error handling
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 2.3_

- [x] 9. Verify measurement precision and formatting consistency






  - Ensure Manual Mode uses same precision (rounded to nearest millimeter) as Auto Mode
  - Verify measurement display formatting matches Auto Mode exactly
  - Test that corrected measurements maintain proper significant digits
  - Validate measurement units are consistently displayed as millimeters
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 5.4, 5.5_


- [x] 10. Perform end-to-end validation and regression testing





  - Test that Auto Mode measurements remain unchanged after modifications
  - Verify Manual Mode shape detection quality is preserved

  - Test measurement accuracy with objects of known dimensions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_
